Studied about SRCNN and three important parts of the network. 1)Patch Extraction and Representation,2)Non-Linear Mapping,3)Reconstruction
Studied about the loss function , Mean Square Error(MSE) and how different and efficient SRCNN is over other methods.
Learnt about Bicubic Interpolation and two types of interpolation..Adaptive and non-adaptive.Also learnt the basic formula what creates the interpolated surface of the 2D image. 
How diffetrent Bilinear and nearest-neighbor methods different. Also learnt the limitations of Bicubic Interpolation.
Studied a little about Keras and its applications and how Tensorflow helps in building and training ML models easily using high-level APIs.
